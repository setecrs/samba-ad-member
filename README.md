# Introduction

Samba : the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix.
This container aims to run a Samba server registered as a member of a given Active Directory domain, choosing a main "shared" directory and enabling inside directories as they are enabled by the administrator. 

# Quick start
Run the Samba image.

> Replace <host ip address> by the local ip of the machine executing docker runtime.

```

```
